# Personal-Portfolio
Data projects done in my free time of varying interests. Mostly to apply my education to real world business problems and showcase my interests.

## [Uplift Model](uplift-models/README.md)
Use uplift modeling to identify customers that will make a conversion if exposed to an ad, and determine the incremental gain over a control group.

## [Propensity Score Matching](propensity_match/README.md)
Use propensity score matching to remove covariant imbalance and selection bias before determining whether a skewed treated group has an actual incremental lift.
